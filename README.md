# RFM-Analysis-Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation Project with RFM Analysis

The diamond industry is known for its complexity and the intricate interplay of factors that influence the pricing of these exquisite gemstones. Accurate and data-driven price prediction in this market is of paramount importance for businesses, investors, and consumers alike. In response to this demand, we embarked on a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at developing a predictive model for diamond prices.

### Problem Statement
The core challenge addressed in this project is the creation of a reliable predictive model that can estimate the price of diamonds based on a set of key attributes. The objective is to leverage the wealth of data available in the diamond industry to build a model that can provide valuable insights into the factors driving price variations.

### Project Objectives
Our project is guided by the following key objectives:

- Develop a predictive machine learning model capable of estimating diamond prices with a high degree of accuracy.
- Identify and analyze the key features that play a significant role in determining diamond prices.
- Uncover insights from the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the diamond market.
- Evaluate the model's performance using established regression evaluation metrics.

### Data Source
The full dataset as well as the description of the features can be found here: [Kaggle Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds)

### Methodology
Our approach to solving this problem involves the following key steps:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): We conducted EDA to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns in the data.
2. Model development: We chose an appropriate regression algorithm and trained the model on the prepared data.
3. Model evaluation: We assessed the model's performance using industry-standard regression evaluation metrics.

### Structure of the Report
This report is organized as follows:

1. Introduction: This section provides an overview of the project's objectives and methodology.
2. Importing libraries: We import the necessary libraries for the project, dividing them in categories according to their use.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We present the findings from our data exploration.
4. Price Predictive Model: We select an algorithm, preprocess the data and train the predictive model.
5. Conclusion: We summarize our findings, highlight the implications for the diamond industry, and describe the next steps.
